Ensemble Models in ML

# Problem:
Using the Bank Data csv file, create a new notebook to train, test, and evaluate an ensemble model and compare the results with a single Decision Tree.

# Abstract:
Cypress from New Ventures Department has found a banking client who wants to do a targeted marketing campaign for a specialty investment product to some of its customers. Cypress stresses that the bank only wants to spend the effort on customers who are likely to say yes; last year they used a different company to generate an algorithm and ended up spamming many of their customers with products they didn't want.

### Data exploration.
- **Data Cleaning**
    - Looking for Missing Values
- **Formatting the variables**
    - Binary Variables
    - One Hot Encoding
- **Visual Exploration of the variables**
    - Categorical Variables
    - Numerical Variables

### Analysis.
- **Split Data Set**
- **Hyperparameter Settings**
    - Choosing the best hyperparameters for the `decision tree` model
    - Choosing the best hyperparameters for the `random forest` model
- **Comparison between Models**
    - Visualize Confusion Matrix
        - *Decision Tree Confusion Matrix*
        - *Random Forest Confusion Matrix*
    - Visualization of the Trees
        - *Decision Tree*
        - *Random Forest*
- **Performance Comparison**
